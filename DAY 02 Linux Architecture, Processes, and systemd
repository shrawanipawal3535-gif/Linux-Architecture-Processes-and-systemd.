Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd

DAY 02

1️)Core Components of Linux?
-Linux is mainly divided into three parts:
*Kernel:
-The heart of Linux
-Talks directly to hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
-Without the kernel, Linux cannot run

*User:
-Where users and applications work
-Includes:
Shell (bash)
Commands (ls, cd, ps, top)
Applications (nginx, docker, python)

*shell:
-he first process started when Linux boots
-Process ID = 1
-Responsible for starting and managing system services

2)How Processes Are Created and Managed?

-A process is a running program (example: nginx, python, java)
*Every process has:
-PID (Process ID)
-Parent process (PPID)
*Process creation flow:
-User runs a command
-Shell requests the kernel
-Kernel creates a new process
-Process gets CPU time and memory
*Process management includes:
-Starting processes
-Stopping/killing processes
-Monitoring CPU & memory usage
*Common commands:
-ps → view running processes
-top / htop → live process monitoring
-kill → stop a process

3)What systemd Does and Why It Matters?

-systemd is the modern service manager in Linux.
*It:
-Starts services at boot
-Stops, restarts, and monitors services
-Handles system logs and dependencies
Examples:
-Start a service: systemctl start nginx
-Stop a service: systemctl stop nginx
-Check status: systemctl status nginx
-Enable service on boot: systemctl enable nginx
*Why systemd is important for DevOps:
-Manages servers automatically.
-Restarts crashed services
